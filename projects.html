            LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:</button>
        <div class="project-content">
            <h2 class="project-title"><b>ABSTRACT</b></h2>
            <p>The Library Management System project was primarily developed as a sophisticated control system, featuring an administrative interface and multiple user profiles. The administrator holds the authority to add numerous users and seamlessly integrate books into the database by scanning QR codes affixed to each book.Within this system, users, particularly students, have the capability to peruse the entire library catalog. In collaboration with the administrator, they can efficiently initiate book transactions, including issuing and returning books. Notably, the user interface provides visibility into both the issue and return dates for each transaction, enhancing transparency and accountability.<br><br>This project leverages a technology stack encompassing Python for backend functionality, MongoDB for database management, and a frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The synergistic integration of these technologies culminates in a highly effective and user-friendly library management system, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention.</p>
            <h2 class="project-title">WORKING MODEL</h2>
            <p>The components employed in this project consist of a <b>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</b>, serving as the dedicated server for hosting the website. Additionally, a <b>mobile phone or laptop camera</b> functions as a high-performance QR code scanner, facilitating seamless interaction with the system. This configuration ensures optimal performance and a sophisticated user experience.</p>
            <h2 class="project-title">OUTCOMES</h2>
            <p>The final outcomes of this project include an automated and streamlined library management process, enhanced user experience, and a robust system for tracking book transactions. The utilization of QR codes for book identification further contributes to the efficiency and accuracy of the system.</p>
